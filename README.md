## What is Exercism?

Exercism ([http://exercism.io/][ex]) is a place where programmers help each other level up their coding skills.

There are practice exercises in 30 programming languages. You solve an exercise and submit it to the website where you can discuss trade-offs and improvements with other programmers.
